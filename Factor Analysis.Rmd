## Setting up Data Frame
```{r df, comment= ""}
MMW <- read.csv('MMWSURVEY.csv')[, -1]
MMW <- na.omit(MMW)
options(width= 90)
head(MMW, 6)
```

## Scale Reliability
```{r alpha, comment= ""}
cronbach.alpha(MMW)
```

*The overall internal consistency reliability is estimated at __80.7%__.*


## Bartlett’s test of sphericity

_Ho: the population correlation matrix is an identity matrix (variables are uncorrelated)_

_Ha: the population correlation matrix is not an identity matrix (variables are correlated)_

```{r cor, comment= ""}
cor <- cor(MMW)
cortest.bartlett(cor, n= nrow(MMW))
```

*The population correlation matrix is not an identity matrix (variables are correlated).*


## Measure of Sampling Adequacy (MSA)
```{r kmo, comment= ""}
KMO(cor)
```

*The overall MSA of __0.902__ is considered excellent. Meanwhile, the individual MSA range from mostly good to excellent.*


## Sample Size
```{r sample, comment= ""}
dim(MMW)
```

\newpage

## Parallel Analysis 
```{r fa.p, comment= ""}
set.seed(123)
fa.parallel(MMW, fa= "both", fm= "minres")
```

## Factor Analysis Model 
```{r fa.m, comment= ""}
f_model <- fa(MMW, nfactors= 5)
f_model
```

## Specific details of the FA Model

*Variance Accounted*
```{r vac, comment= ""}
f_model$Vaccounted
```

*Factor Correlations*
```{r fc, comment= ""}
f_model$Phi
```

*Factor Analysis Diagram*
```{r fa.d, comment= ""}
fa.diagram(f_model)
```

*Mean Item Complexity*
```{r mic, comment= ""}
f_model$complexity
mean(f_model$complexity)
```

*The null model and objective function*
```{r num, comment= ""}
f_model$null.model
```

\newpage

*Model*
```{r m, comment= ""}
f_model$null.dof
```

*Chi-square*
```{r chi, comment= ""}
f_model$null.chisq
```

*Root mean square error of approximation*
```{r rmsea, comment= ""}
f_model$RMSEA
```

*Tucker Lewis Index*
```{r tli, comment= ""}
f_model$TLI
```

## Factor Analysis Diagram using Varimax
```{r fa.va, comment= ""}
f_diagram.var <- fac(MMW, 5, rotate = "varimax")
fa.diagram(f_diagram.var, main = "Varimax")
```

## Naming of Factors

**Factor 1 (Problem-Solving Factor)**

> POTS 5 -  I can tackle a challenging MMW problem.
 
> POTS 6 - I believe I can get better at math.

> POTS 8 - I can solve word problems.

> POTS 17 - I ask questions when I am unsure of a problem.

> POTS 18 - I’m certain I can figure out how to solve difficult math problems.

> POTS 19 - Time spent learning why a solution works is time well spent.

> POTS 21 - Even if the concepts in MMW class are hard, I can learn them.

**Factor 2 (Accomplishment Factor)**

> POTS 2 - I can work with a partner to find a solution to a problem.

> POTS 3 - I feel accomplished when I solve a problem.

> POTS 4 - I work hard in my MMW classes.

> POTS 10 - I complete assignments outside of class.

> POTS 22 - It’s important for me to do really well in MMW.

> POTS 24 - I always find other ways to learn MMW like searching on the internet.

**Factor 3 (Real-world Application Factor)**

> POTS 15 - Discussing different solutions is a good way of learning MMW exercises.

> POTS 16 - Achievement and effort in MMW class are likely to lead to job success later on.

> POTS 20 - I can use what I learn in MMW class in other subjects.

> POTS 23 - I can name several ways I use MMW topics in my day-to-day life.

**Factor 4 (Subject Expectations Factor)**

> POTS 1 - My MMW teacher has been unsuccessful with helping me to appreciate math.

> POTS 7 - I find it difficult to focus during MMW class.

> POTS 11 - My only interest in MMW is getting a passing score.

> POTS 12 - I like doing MMW activities.

> POTS 13 -  I think I will do/have done well in MMW this semester.

> POTS 14 - MMW can be fun.

**Factor 5 (Complacent Factor)**

> POTS 9 - Getting the right answer is more important than understanding why the answer works.
